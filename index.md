# Welcome to the 2024 Professional Development Hack Day
### The event will be on Tuesday, July 2nd
Thanks to Karl for funding snacks and lunch!

In the top menu you can find links to resources for each of the topics people hack on.

Please feel free to add material to/edit this website (there are 'edit page' links at the bottom of each page, or you can use git through [this repo](https://github.com/OttoStruve/profDevHackDay2024)). If you need help or don't have access, talk to Sam. Check out this [link](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) for a markdown tutorial, or this [file](https://github.com/OttoStruve/profDevHackDay2024/blob/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md?plain=1) with some basic markdown examples.

## Tentative Schedule for Tuesday, July 2nd
We will have a [zoom session](https://utexas.zoom.us/j/96008337325) going for those of you who want to attend remotely. Also, feel free to chat in the #hackday2024 channel in the astrodata slack (again, talk to Sam if you need to be added to that slack).
