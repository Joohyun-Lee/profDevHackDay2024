A resume is a document that summarizes your education, experiences, and skills. It is typically used for non-accademic job applications. Unlike a CV this is not an extensive list but a short summary of your qualifications and should be tailored to the job you are applying for.
- Templates on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates?q=resume).
- Lots of useful resources on the CNS Career Services website: [https://careerservices.cns.utexas.edu/resources/resumes](https://careerservices.cns.utexas.edu/resources/resumes)

- I write my resumes in Word so it is easier to tweak formatting. Here is a resume I used for a recent (non-academic) job aplication at The Aerospace Corporation: [resume.docx](/assets/resume/sf/resume.docx).
