A CV or Curriculum vitae is an extensive list of your academic and professional accomplishments. It is a document that is used to apply for academic positions, scholarships, grants, and other opportunities. Here are some resources to help you create your CV:
- Templates on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates?q=cv).
- Lots of useful resources on the CNS Career Services website: [https://careerservices.cns.utexas.edu/resources/resumes](https://careerservices.cns.utexas.edu/resources/resumes)
